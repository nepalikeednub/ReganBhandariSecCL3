		<h1>Graphic design</h1>
		<p>Graphic design is the process of visual communication and problem-solving through the use of typography, photography, iconography and illustration. The field is considered a subset of visual communication and communication design, but sometimes the term "graphic design" is used synonymously. Graphic designers create and combine symbols, images and text to form visual representations of ideas and messages.

			They use typography, visual arts, and page layout techniques to create visual compositions. Common applications of graphic design include corporate design (logos and branding), editorial design (magazines, newspapers and books), wayfinding or environmental design, advertising, web design, communication design, product packaging, and signage.</p>

		<h1>The advent of printing</h1>
		<p>During the Tang Dynasty (618–907) wood blocks were cut to print on textiles 
			
			and later to reproduce Buddhist texts. A Buddhist scripture printed in 868 is 
			the earliest known printed book. Beginning in the 11th century, longer scrolls and
			 books were produced using movable type printing, making books widely available during the Song dynasty (960–1279).[5]

			During the 17th-18th century movable type was used for 
			handbills or trade cards which were printed from wood or 
			copper engravings. These documents announced a business and its location.
			 English painter William Hogarth used his skill in engraving was one of the first to design for business trade.</p>
